                     <b> <em>Raising children in this interconnected era has become more challenging than ever. The internet can be a fantastic educational tool, but without parental control software and careful supervision it can be a dangerous place. Here are some of the critical concerns from parents:</em></b>
                    </br><h4>Is there a way for me to check on my kid’s online behavior? Yes.</h4>
                    
•	Review the history of the search engine that they are using (Chrome: Ctr+H)</br>
•	Review their YouTube watch history and the list of suggested material.</br>
•	Check their Cookies history.</br>
<h4>Limitation: Kids have become very tech savvy and have found ways of hiding their online activity from parents by</h4>
•	Clearing their search history and/or cookies on their browser</br>
•	using private browsing feature so their parents can’t see the sites they’ve hit (Info provided by “Enough is enough”)</br>
So the most effective way is to use a parental control. It allows parents to monitor online activity (social media, sites) unpredictably for a kid and, if needed, block a private browsing feature.

                       <em> NOTE: Parental control software is no substitute for good communication. If you don't want your kids to visit unsafe, unsavory, or inappropriate sites, talk to them about your concerns. We recommend that you also take the time to convince your older kids that you'll respect their privacy while still monitoring their online actions, a promise you should strive to uphold. We prefer software that embraces this kind of collaborative approach, rather than apps that covertly spy on kids. If your kids see you as big brother, it's a safe bet that they'll find ways to outsmart you and evade even the most sophisticated systems. As tech addiction increasingly becomes a problem, it's important to instill the value of good device habits on to your children as well.</em>
